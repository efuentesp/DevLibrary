"""Fuzz the support-bundle redaction chokepoint.

``observal support bundle`` collects configuration, health probes and recent
log lines into an archive that operators hand to third parties for diagnosis.
``dev_library_cli.support.redaction`` is the single point every value passes
through on the way in, so a miss here leaks credentials outside the
deployment. It is a separate implementation from the server-side ingest
redactor: different patterns, plus a Shannon-entropy rule over tokenised
input.

The oracle is the contract the module's property tests already assert:
redaction is idempotent, so a second pass must be a no-op.
