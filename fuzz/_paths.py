"""Source-tree bootstrap shared by every fuzz target.

Fuzz targets run as standalone scripts, both from a checkout and from the
PyInstaller bundle OSS-Fuzz builds. ``dev_library_cli`` and ``observal_shared``
ship as installed packages, but ``observal-server`` is only ever placed on
``sys.path`` -- the same arrangement ``tests/conftest.py`` uses.

Every entry is skipped when it does not exist, so this is a no-op inside the
frozen bundle where the modules are already embedded.
