"""Parallel section prompts for Agent Insights narrative generation.

Ground-up V4 rewrite modeled after pi /insights prompts.

Key differences from V3:
- Second-person voice ("you") throughout, not third-person analyst tone
- Prompts include session_summaries, friction_details, user_instructions
  so the LLM has real examples to cite (not just raw metrics)
- Interaction style section added (the single biggest quality differentiator)
- Suggestions split into config_additions, features_to_try, usage_patterns
  with copyable prompts and concrete code examples
- At-a-glance synthesis is coaching tone, not corporate summary

Your reader is the developer who uses this agent every day. They want to understand their own patterns, what is working, what is failing, and what to try next.

Writing style:
- Use SECOND PERSON ("you", "your") throughout. Never "the user" or "the developer".
- Be DIRECT and SPECIFIC. Every sentence must reference actual data, specific sessions, or concrete observations.
- CONCISE. Scale output to the data volume: 1-3 sessions = brief. 10+ sessions = richer analysis.
- HONEST. If the agent failed tasks, say so clearly. Don't soften real problems.
- INSIGHTFUL. Surface patterns the reader wouldn't notice from raw numbers. Connect dots between metrics.
- NO FILLER. Never pad with generic observations or restate what metrics already show.
- Reference specific session examples from the SESSION SUMMARIES when available.
- Use **bold** for key insights in narrative text.

Rules:
- config_additions: PRIORITIZE instructions from USER INSTRUCTIONS and REPEATED INSTRUCTIONS sections. These are things the user has ALREADY told the agent but it keeps forgetting. Maximum 7.
- features_to_try: 2-3 concrete suggestions.
- usage_patterns: 2-4 suggestions for how to prompt differently. Each must include a copyable prompt the user can try immediately.
- NEVER suggest vague improvements. Be specific: include the exact text, command, or config.
- If COMPONENT UTILIZATION marks a component unused/harmful, you may suggest action_type=remove_component with the existing component id/name and risk.
- Every suggested action must include confidence and risk.

REUSING WHAT ALREADY EXISTS (most important rule):
If a "Reusable Components Already In This Registry" section is present, it lists approved
components this agent is NOT yet using. Building something the user already owns wastes
their time, so:
- FIRST check whether a listed component genuinely solves an observed problem.
- If one does, use action_type=reuse_existing_component, set "existing_component_id" to that
  entry's `id` copied EXACTLY, set "feature" to its type, and explain the fit in "match_reason".
- Only suggest create_new_skill / create_new_hook when NOTHING listed fits. When you create
  something new despite the list being non-empty, say why in "why_for_you".
- ONLY suggest a match when it genuinely fits. A forced or approximate match is worse than
  no suggestion: it sends the user to install something that will not help. If nothing fits,
  do not reuse anything.
- NEVER invent an id. Any id not copied from the list is discarded, and the suggestion with it.
- MCP servers may be RECOMMENDED FOR REUSE from the list, but never invented: do not propose
  creating a new MCP server.

FEATURE FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:

For Skills, the "example" field MUST be a complete SKILL.md with frontmatter:
```
---
name: <name>
description: "<one_liner>"
version: 1.0.0
task_type: general
---

# <name>

<Step-by-step procedure the agent follows when this skill is invoked.
Be specific. Reference real tools (Read, Edit, Bash, etc.) and commands.>
```

For Hooks, the "example" field MUST be a valid shell script with this header comment:
```
# Hook: <event description>
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
<actual shell commands that accomplish the hook's purpose>
```

Valid hook events (use ONE in the "# Hook:" comment):
- "before tool use" -> PreToolUse (sync, runs before each tool call)
- "after tool use" -> PostToolUse (async, runs after each tool call)
- "session end" -> Stop (blocking, runs when session ends)
- "before prompt" -> UserPromptSubmit (sync, runs before user prompt is sent)
- "session start" -> SessionStart (async, runs when session begins)

The "name" field must be a short kebab-case identifier (max 30 chars).
Good: "scope-guard", "pre-commit-lint", "test-gate", "branch-cleanup"
Bad: "hook-that-checks-whether-files-are-in-scope", "custom-skill-for-testing"

COMPONENT-AWARE ANALYSIS:
If "Agent Configuration" is present:
- If users repeatedly attempt tasks the agent can't do, suggest a skill
- If the system prompt is missing guidance for common user requests, suggest specific prompt additions
- If tool_errors are high, suggest a validation hook
- For registry components, include: `dev-library agent add skill <id>`

SKILLS (include at least 1 skill suggestion, reused or new):
- Identify the user's most repetitive workflows from goal_categories and session summaries
- If a listed reusable component already covers that workflow, reuse it instead of writing a new one
- Otherwise suggest a specific skill with name, description, and the full SKILL.md content
- The skill content must be actionable steps using real tools, not pseudocode

HOOKS TO ADD (include if friction warrants it):
- If tool_errors are high, suggest a pre-execution validation hook
- If wrong_approach friction is common, suggest a confirmation gate hook
- If excessive_changes friction exists, suggest a scope-guard hook
- The hook script must be a real executable shell script, not pseudocode""",
