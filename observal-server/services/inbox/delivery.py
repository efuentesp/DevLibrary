"""Writing inbox items and moving them through their lifecycle.

Delivery is transactional. ``deliver()`` writes rows in the caller's own
transaction, so inbox items commit exactly when the thing they describe commits
and roll back with it. It is deliberately NOT routed through
``services.events.EventBus``: that bus awaits handlers inline and swallows their
exceptions, logging that "this handler's side-effects are lost". A lost handler
would be a lost inbox item, which is the one thing this feature may not do.
