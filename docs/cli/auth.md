# `dev-library auth`

Authentication and account management.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dev-library auth login` | Authenticate with credentials or browser SSO |
| `dev-library auth logout` | Revoke the remote session when possible and clear local credentials |
| `dev-library auth whoami` | Show the authenticated user |
| `dev-library auth status` | Check authenticated server and local outbox health |
| `dev-library auth change-password` | Change the current user's password |
| `dev-library auth set-username` | Set or update the registry namespace username |

## Login

```bash
dev-library auth login
dev-library auth login --server https://observal.example.com --email alice
dev-library auth login --sso
```

Login accepts `server`, `email`, `password`, `name`, `sso`, `saml`, `output`, and `no-setup` options. Prefer `OBSERVAL_PASSWORD` or `OBSERVAL_PASSWORD_FILE` over the password option so the secret does not enter shell history or process arguments.

Human login always asks for the server URL unless `--server` is supplied; leave the prompt blank to use `http://localhost`. On a fresh server, provide email, name, and a password to create the first administrator. JSON mode never prompts, uses the configured server or local default, and requires complete credential inputs.

Successful human login synchronizes the bundled skills, creates the initial layer snapshot, and runs doctor. Select `no-setup` to skip the snapshot and doctor. JSON mode skips those post-login steps.

Every CLI invocation also computes a SHA-256 hash for each installed Observal-managed skill tree. A mismatched tree is replaced completely from the packaged bundle, including references and scripts, so local edits and stale extra files do not survive. Skill directories outside the six bundled Observal names are untouched.

Credential JSON login emits one safe object and never includes tokens or passwords:

```bash
OBSERVAL_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/observal-password \
  dev-library auth login \
  --server https://observal.example.com \
  --email alice \
  --output json
```

Browser SSO in JSON mode is a JSON Lines stream. The first event contains the verification URL and user code. The final event confirms authentication:

```bash
dev-library auth login --sso --output json
```

## Logout

```bash
dev-library auth logout
dev-library auth logout --output json
```

Logout always removes local tokens when the local configuration is readable. Remote revocation is best effort and is reported separately in JSON. Use `dev-library doctor cleanup` to remove Observal-managed harness hooks.

## Current user

```bash
dev-library auth whoami
dev-library auth whoami --output json
```

The JSON form returns the server user object directly.

## Status

```bash
dev-library auth status
dev-library auth status --output json
```

Status reports the server URL, authentication state, health latency, and local telemetry outbox. It returns exit code 3 when authentication is absent and exit code 9 when the configured server is unreachable.

## Change password

```bash
dev-library auth change-password
```

Both modes read `OBSERVAL_CURRENT_PASSWORD` and `OBSERVAL_NEW_PASSWORD`, including their corresponding `_FILE` forms. Human mode prompts for missing values; JSON mode requires both values and never prompts.

```bash
OBSERVAL_CURRENT_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/current-password \
OBSERVAL_NEW_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/new-password \
  dev-library auth change-password --output json
```

Passwords require at least 12 characters, one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character.

## Set username

```bash
dev-library auth set-username alice
dev-library auth set-username alice --output json
```

The username is the user's registry namespace. It must follow the namespace rules shown by command help. The server prevents changes that conflict with another namespace or published registry ownership.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `OBSERVAL_SERVER_URL` | Default server URL |
| `OBSERVAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Pre-authenticate commands without login |
| `OBSERVAL_PASSWORD` | Credential or bootstrap login password |
| `OBSERVAL_CURRENT_PASSWORD` | Current password for JSON password changes |
| `OBSERVAL_NEW_PASSWORD` | New password for JSON password changes and mandatory login changes |
| `OBSERVAL_TIMEOUT` | Authenticated client timeout |

Password and token variables support a corresponding `_FILE` form. Do not set a direct value and its file form together.
