# `dev-library team`

Create and govern teamspaces, members, visibility reviews, join requests, and private-team invitations.

Every leaf command supports `--output table|json`. JSON success output contains no Rich text or prompts. JSON failures leave stdout empty and write one categorized error object to stderr.

| `show` | Show a teamspace and its members |
| `create` | Create a teamspace |

| `delete` | Permanently delete a teamspace |
| `leave` | Leave a teamspace |
| `visibility set` | Change visibility or request public review |

## List, show, and claim

```bash
dev-library team list --output json
dev-library team list --all --output json
dev-library team show platform-tools --output json
dev-library team claim-personal --output json
```

`list` returns the standard `items`, `total`, `page`, and `page_size` envelope. The default includes teamspaces where the user is a member. `--all` requests all teamspaces visible to the caller. Empty results use `items: []` and `page_size: 0`.

`show` returns a combined result:

```json
{
  "team": {
    "id": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
    "name": "Platform Tools",
    "handle": "platform-tools",
    "role": "owner"
  },
  "members": []
}
```

`claim-personal` is idempotent. It creates or returns the caller's one private personal teamspace and returns the direct Team object.

## Create and visibility

```bash
dev-library team create 'Platform Tools' \
  --handle platform-tools \
  --description 'Internal tooling' \
  --visibility private \
  --output json

dev-library team visibility set platform-tools public --output json
```

Visibility is `public` or `private`. Creating a public teamspace or setting a private teamspace to public submits a review request. Until approval, the response reports `visibility: "private"` and `visibility_request_status: "pending"`.

Create and visibility JSON return the direct Team object.

Reviewers and deployment admins manage pending public visibility requests:

```bash
dev-library team visibility list-requests --output json
dev-library team visibility approve platform-tools --output json
dev-library team visibility reject platform-tools \
  --reason 'Add a public description' \
  --output json
```

The list returns the standard list envelope. Approve and reject return the direct Team object. Approval makes the teamspace public and revokes its private invitation links. A rejection reason is optional and accepts up to 500 characters.

## Delete and leave

```bash
dev-library team delete platform-tools --yes --output json
dev-library team leave platform-tools --yes --output json
```

Delete is permanent. Leave removes only the caller's membership. The last owner cannot leave. Human mode prompts unless `--yes` is supplied. JSON mode never prompts and requires `--yes`.

Both endpoints currently return an empty JSON object on success.

## Join requests

Request access to a visible teamspace:

```bash
dev-library team request join platform-tools \
  --message 'I maintain deployments' \
  --output json
```

The message is optional and limited to 500 characters. JSON returns the created join request.

View your own status or withdraw the sole pending request:

```bash
dev-library team request mine platform-tools --output json
dev-library team request withdraw platform-tools --yes --output json
```

`request mine` returns the standard list envelope with requests ordered newest first. `request withdraw` finds the caller's pending request and marks it cancelled. Human mode prompts unless `--yes` is supplied. JSON mode requires `--yes` and returns an empty object.

Owners and deployment admins can list and decide requests:

```bash
dev-library team request list platform-tools --status pending --output json
dev-library team request approve platform-tools @alice --output json
dev-library team request reject platform-tools bob@example.com \
  --reason 'Use the SRE teamspace' \
  --output json
```

Valid status filters are `pending`, `approved`, `rejected`, and `cancelled`. Approve and reject select a pending request by exact email or case-insensitive username. A missing pending request uses not-found exit code 5.

The list returns the standard list envelope. Join, approve, and reject return the direct join-request object.

## Members

```bash
dev-library team members list platform-tools --output json
dev-library team members add platform-tools alice@example.com --role reviewer --output json
dev-library team members add platform-tools @bob --role owner --output json
dev-library team members remove platform-tools @bob --yes --output json
```

Roles are `member`, `reviewer`, and `owner`. Adding an existing member updates the role. The last owner cannot be removed.

Member list returns the standard list envelope. Add returns the saved member. Remove currently returns an empty object.

Human remove prompts unless `--yes` is supplied. JSON remove requires `--yes`.

## Private-team invitations

Create and list invitations:

```bash
dev-library team invite create platform-tools \
  --name onboarding \
  --expires-days 30 \
  --max-uses 20 \
  --output json

dev-library team invite list platform-tools --output json
```

`--expires-days` accepts 1 through 365. `--max-uses` accepts 1 through 10,000 or may be omitted for no use limit. Invite names accept 1 through 100 characters.

Create returns the direct invitation object, including the one-time token and URL. Treat both as secrets. List returns the standard list envelope. States include active, expired, exhausted, and revoked.

A recipient can preview the token, then submit an owner-reviewed access request:

```bash
dev-library team invite preview INVITE_TOKEN --output json
dev-library team invite request INVITE_TOKEN \
  --message 'I am joining the deployment rotation' \
  --output json
```

`invite preview` does not mutate membership or request state. `invite request` does not grant membership. It creates a pending join request that an owner must approve. Neither command prints the token in human output or errors.

Owners and admins can inspect invitation usage:

```bash
dev-library team invite requests \
  platform-tools \
  550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 \
  --output json
```

The command returns the standard list envelope for requests associated with that invitation. Empty results use `items: []`.

Revoke an invitation while retaining its audit history:

```bash
dev-library team invite revoke \
  platform-tools \
  550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 \
  --yes \
  --output json
```

Delete an invitation only when it has no uses or request history:

```bash
dev-library team invite delete \
  platform-tools \
  550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 \
  --yes \
  --output json
```

The invite ID must be a UUID. Human mode prompts unless `--yes` is supplied. JSON mode requires `--yes`. Revoke returns the invitation object. Delete returns an empty object.
