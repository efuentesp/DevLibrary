# `dev-library api`

Call an authenticated JSON endpoint when no dedicated high-level command exists.

## Examples

```bash
dev-library api GET /api/v1/teams --output json
dev-library api GET /api/v1/agents --param limit=10 --param page=2 --output json
dev-library api POST /api/v1/teams --from-file team.json --output json
cat team.json | dev-library api POST /api/v1/teams --output json
```

Methods are `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`. Paths must be canonical relative `/api/v1/` paths. Full URLs, traversal segments, fragments, and inline query strings are rejected. Use repeatable `--param KEY=VALUE` options for query parameters.

The command uses the configured bearer token. It does not accept arbitrary authorization headers, so it cannot forward credentials to another host.

## Request bodies

`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` accept one JSON object from `--from-file` or standard input. A file takes precedence when both are present. `GET` rejects request bodies.

## Output

Table mode renders arbitrary objects as field and value rows. JSON mode preserves the endpoint response exactly, including top-level arrays. This raw behavior is intentional and is the exception to dedicated list commands, which use the standard list envelope.

## Errors and retries

The command uses the shared categorized error contract and preserves server request IDs. Automatic transient retries apply only to `GET`. After an uncertain mutation failure, read endpoint state before retrying. See [Mutation retries and idempotency](idempotency.md).

Prefer dedicated commands when they exist because they provide stronger validation, safer confirmation, and domain-specific output.
