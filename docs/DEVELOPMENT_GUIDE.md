## Community Standards

We are a small, active community and we take the quality of interactions seriously.

> [!WARNING]
> The following will result in a **moderator warning**. A second violation results in a **temporary or permanent ban** from the repository and Discord:
>
> * Pinging contributors, maintainers, or reviewers unnecessarily (outside of a direct reply on your own open PR or issue)
> * Submitting low-effort or unreviewed PRs (slop), including unreviewed AI output or autonomous agent submissions
> * Violating the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Observal/Observal/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in any channel
> * Harassing reviewers over merge timelines

Maintainers volunteer their time. Treat them accordingly.

### A note on autonomous coding agents

**Autonomous coding agents (Devin, SWE-agent, OpenHands, etc.) are not permitted to submit PRs.** This is a legal constraint, not a quality judgment. The US Copyright Office's 2025 guidance confirms that purely AI-generated code has no copyright owner, which breaks our CLA and our ability to license and enforce the project. See the [AI Policy](../AI_POLICY.md) for the full explanation.

## Prerequisites

| Tool    | Version             | Install                                                                   |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Docker  | 24+ with Compose v2 | [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)                    |
| uv      | latest              | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh`                        |
| Node.js | 20+                 | Via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) |
| pnpm    | 10+                 | `npm install -g pnpm`                                                     |
| Git     | 2.28+               | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)                                       |

Verify your Docker installation supports Compose v2:

```bash
docker compose version
# should print: Docker Compose version v2.x.x
```

If you see `docker-compose: command not found` or a v1 version, upgrade Docker Desktop or install the Compose plugin separately.

***

## Git Setup

### SSH authentication

Using SSH is strongly recommended, it avoids password prompts and is required if you enable 2FA on GitHub.

```bash
# Generate a key (skip if you already have one at ~/.ssh/id_ed25519)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"

# Copy the public key to your clipboard
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Add the output to **GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key**.

Test it:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
# Hi your-username! You've successfully authenticated...
```

### Git identity

Set your identity so it matches your GitHub account:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

If you want to sign commits with GPG as well (optional but appreciated):

```bash
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_GPG_KEY_ID
```

### Fork and clone

You only need to do this once. For every subsequent contribution, just create a new branch on your existing fork.

1. Fork the repository on GitHub (top-right **Fork** button).
2. Clone your fork using SSH:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/Observal.git
cd Observal
```

1. Add the upstream remote so you can pull in changes from the main repo:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Observal/Observal.git
```

1. Verify your remotes:

```bash
git remote -v
# origin    git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/Observal.git (fetch)
# origin    git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/Observal.git (push)
# upstream  https://github.com/Observal/Observal.git (fetch)
# upstream  https://github.com/Observal/Observal.git (push)
```

***

## First-time Setup

### Install pre-commit hooks

Do this **before your first commit**. The hooks run ruff, format checkers, secret scanners, SPDX header injection, and migration chain validation automatically.

```bash
make hooks
```

### Start the Docker stack

```bash
cp .env.example .env
make up
```

The first build takes several minutes while Docker downloads and compiles images. Subsequent starts are fast.

Watch progress with:

```bash
make logs
```

For normal code and dependency changes, prefer the fast rebuild target:

```bash
make rebuild-fast
```

`make rebuild-fast` is not a separate dev profile and does not enable hot reload. It uses the same Docker Compose stack as `make rebuild`, but only builds the two app images that contain local code:

* `observal-api`, shared by the API, init, and worker services
* `observal-web`, used by the web service

Then it starts the full stack with the freshly built images.

Wait until all services are healthy:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml ps
# All services should show "healthy" or "running"
```

**Default endpoints:**

| Service              | URL                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| LB (all traffic)     | `http://localhost`      |
| Web UI (direct)      | `http://localhost:3000` |
| Prometheus, optional | `http://localhost:9090` |
| Grafana, optional    | `http://localhost:3001` |
| ClickHouse HTTP      | `http://localhost:8123` |

### Install the CLI

```bash
uv tool install --editable .
```

### Log in

```bash
dev-library auth login
```

On a fresh server, this bootstraps the admin account automatically. Use `super@demo.example` / `super-changeme` for the super\_admin account.

### Demo accounts

Seeded automatically on first startup:

| Email                | Password         | Role         |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| `super@demo.example` | `super-changeme` | super\_admin |
| `admin@demo.example` | `admin-changeme` | admin        |
| `dev@demo.example`   | `dev-changeme`   | developer    |
| `user@demo.example`  | `user-changeme`  | user         |

***

## Make Targets Reference

```bash
make up            # start the full Docker stack
make down          # stop the stack
make rebuild-fast  # fast app rebuild for code and dependency changes
make rebuild       # rebuild every service image and restart
make logs          # tail logs from all services
make test          # run the test suite quickly
make test-v        # verbose test output
make lint          # ruff check + hadolint
make format        # ruff format (auto-fix)
make check         # pre-commit on all files
make hooks         # install pre-commit hooks
make reset         # nuke all volumes and rebuild from scratch (destructive)
```

### Which rebuild target should I use?

| Situation                                                                                    | Target               | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend source changed                                                                       | `make rebuild-fast`  | Rebuilds the shared API image used by API, init, and worker.                                                                                                                           |
| Worker, init, migration, or ClickHouse setup code changed                                    | `make rebuild-fast`  | These services use the same `observal-api` image. This is the safe path for schema and init path changes because it refreshes the image used by `observal-init` and `observal-worker`. |
| Python dependencies changed in `observal-server/pyproject.toml` or `observal-server/uv.lock` | `make rebuild-fast`  | Docker reruns the Python dependency layer when those files change.                                                                                                                     |
| Frontend source changed                                                                      | `make rebuild-fast`  | Rebuilds the web image.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Frontend dependencies changed in `package.json`, `web/package.json`, or `pnpm-lock.yaml`     | `make rebuild-fast`  | Docker reruns the pnpm dependency layer when those files change.                                                                                                                       |
| Compose topology changed                                                                     | `make rebuild`       | Use this for new services, changed image names, changed build contexts, changed profiles, or volume and network changes.                                                               |
| Cache looks stale or the stack behaves unexpectedly                                          | `make rebuild` first | Use `make rebuild-clean` only when you intentionally want a no-cache rebuild with volumes removed.                                                                                     |

`make down` stops containers started by either `make rebuild` or `make rebuild-fast`. Both targets use the same Compose project and the same volumes.

***

## Architecture Overview

Observal is a monorepo:

```
observal-server/    FastAPI backend (Python)
dev_library_cli/       CLI and session exporters (Python)
web/                Next.js 16 / React 19 frontend (TypeScript)
tests/              Shared test suite (~1500 tests, 96 files)
docker/             Docker Compose and Dockerfiles
docs/               Documentation
scripts/            Dev tooling scripts
```

**Databases:**

* **PostgreSQL**, relational data (users, agents, registry, feedback)
* **ClickHouse**, session events, aggregates, audit events, and security events

They are not interchangeable. Never write telemetry to Postgres or relational data to ClickHouse.

**Supporting services:** Redis (pub/sub + arq job queue), arq worker, nginx reverse proxy. Prometheus and Grafana are optional.

See [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/Observal/Observal/blob/main/AGENTS.md) for a complete map of every important file and service.

***

## Git Workflow

### Making a new branch

Always branch from the latest `main`. Never commit directly to `main`.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
# or: fix/my-bug, docs/my-doc
```

### Keeping your branch up to date

If `main` has moved forward while you were working, rebase your branch onto it:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout feature/my-feature
git rebase main
```

Rebasing keeps history linear and makes your PR easier to review than a merge commit would.

### Dealing with merge conflicts

Conflicts arise when the same file was changed in both `main` and your branch. During `git rebase main`, git will pause and show you:

```
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in some/file.py
```

Open the file and look for conflict markers:

```python
<<<<<<< HEAD
# this is what's on main
=======
# this is what's in your branch
>>>>>>> feature/my-feature
```

Edit the file to the correct final state (keeping whichever changes are right, or combining them), then:

```bash
git add some/file.py
git rebase --continue
```

If you get confused and want to start over:

```bash
git rebase --abort
```

After resolving and pushing, use `--force-with-lease` rather than `--force`, it's safer:

```bash
git push origin feature/my-feature --force-with-lease
```

### Submitting a pull request

1. Make sure your branch is rebased on the latest `main` (see above).
2. Push to your fork:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/my-feature
    ```

3. GitHub will show a banner on your fork offering to open a PR. Click it, or go to the [Observal repository](https://github.com/Observal/Observal) directly.
4. Fill in the PR template completely. PRs that do not follow the template will be closed.
5. Link the related issue if one exists (`Fixes #123` in the PR body closes it automatically on merge).

### After review feedback

If a reviewer requests changes, make them on the same branch and push again. Do not open a new PR. If your changes are small fixes to an existing commit, amend rather than adding new commits:

```bash
git add the-changed-file.py
git commit --amend --no-edit
git push origin feature/my-feature --force-with-lease
```

***

## Working on the Backend

### Running tests

Tests mock all external services. Docker does not need to be running.

```bash
make test
make test-v
make test-eval-completeness
make test-adversarial
make test-all
# or directly:
cd observal-server
uv run --with pytest --with pytest-asyncio --with hypothesis --with pyarrow pytest ../tests/ -q
```

### Testing conventions

New Python tests should follow the [Testing Guide](testing/Testing_Guide.md). The current suite has mixed historical patterns, so do not rewrite old tests only for style. When adding or touching tests, prefer the clean pattern documented there: one behavior area per file, small local helper factories, hermetic CLI and API test setup, explicit async mocks, and behavior-focused assertions.

### Running a single test

```bash
cd observal-server
uv run pytest ../tests/test_registry_types.py -q
# or a specific test function:
uv run pytest ../tests/test_registry_types.py::TestMcpRoutes::test_submit_mcp -v
```

### Code coverage

Coverage is collected automatically on the `3.13` matrix run in CI. To generate it locally:

```bash
cd observal-server
uv run pytest ../tests/ --cov=../dev_library_cli --cov=. --cov-report=html -q
# open htmlcov/index.html in your browser
```

### Adding a database migration

```bash
bash scripts/new_migration.sh "describe_your_change"
```

Edit the generated file in `observal-server/alembic/versions/`. Then verify the chain is intact:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_migrations.py
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Never edit an existing migration file. Always create a new one. A broken migration chain blocks CI and prevents the server from starting.

Apply migrations to your local stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm init
```

### Connecting to PostgreSQL directly

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec db \
  psql -U observal -d observal
```

Useful for inspecting tables, running manual queries, or verifying migration results.

### Connecting to ClickHouse directly

ClickHouse exposes an HTTP interface. Use the Play UI in your browser:

```
http://localhost:8123/play
```

Or query from the terminal:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8123/?query=SELECT+count()+FROM+session_events" \
  -u "default:"
```

Or connect with the CLI client:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec clickhouse \
  clickhouse-client --user default
```

### Debugging the API

The API server runs with `--reload` in development mode. Log output is available via:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f observal-api
```

To add a breakpoint, use `breakpoint()` in Python code, the debugger will pause in the container's stdout. Or attach a remote debugger by adding `debugpy` to your dev dependencies and exposing a debug port.

The OpenAPI docs are available at (API port, not through the LB which blocks these paths):

* `http://localhost:8000/docs` (Swagger UI, requires direct API port access)
* `http://localhost:8000/redoc` (ReDoc, requires direct API port access)

> Note: The nginx LB blocks `/docs`, `/redoc`, and `/openapi.json` in production. For local dev, expose the API port directly or use `docker compose exec`.

***

## Working on the Frontend

### Running the frontend in isolation

```bash
cd web
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Create `web/.env.local` with:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost
```

The frontend proxies all `/api/v1/*` calls to the backend URL set by `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.

### Design system

| Token         | Value                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Color space   | OKLCH                                           |
| Themes        | `light`, `dark`, `midnight`, `forest`, `sunset` |
| Display font  | Archivo                                         |
| Body font     | Albert Sans                                     |
| Code font     | JetBrains Mono                                  |
| Spacing base  | 4pt                                             |
| Components    | shadcn/ui                                       |
| Charts        | Recharts                                        |
| Data fetching | TanStack Query                                  |
| Tables        | TanStack Table                                  |

All themes are defined in `web/src/app/globals.css` as CSS custom properties. Semantic tokens (`background`, `foreground`, `card`, `border`, `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `destructive`, `success`, `warning`, `info`) map to OKLCH values per theme.

When adding new UI, use the semantic tokens, never hardcode colors. Check all five themes look correct before submitting.

### Adding a new API endpoint to the frontend

1. Add the TypeScript response type to `web/src/lib/types.ts`.
2. Add the fetch call to `web/src/lib/api.ts`.
3. Add the TanStack Query hook to `web/src/hooks/use-api.ts`.
4. Use the hook in your component.

### Screenshots for UI changes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any PR that touches the web frontend must include **screenshots of all affected screens** in the PR description. This is required regardless of how small the change is. Attach screenshots directly to the PR body, not as review comments.

***

## Working on the CLI

### Reinstalling after changes

The CLI is installed as a uv tool. Changes to source files are reflected immediately because it is installed in editable mode (`--editable`). If you add new entry points or change `pyproject.toml`, reinstall:

```bash
uv tool install --editable . --reinstall
```

### Testing session delivery

Run a harness session with hooks installed, then reconcile and inspect exporter status:

```bash
dev-library reconcile --dry-run
dev-library auth status
dev-library ops telemetry status
```

Session records remain in the local outbox until the server acknowledges them.

***

## Harness Recommendations

### VS Code

Install these extensions for the best experience:

* **Python** (`ms-python.python`), LSP, type checking
* **Pylance** (`ms-python.vscode-pylance`), fast type inference
* **Ruff** (`charliermarsh.ruff`), linting and formatting on save
* **ESLint** (`dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`), JavaScript/TypeScript linting
* **Prettier** (`esbenp.prettier-vscode`), TypeScript formatting
* **Docker** (`ms-azuretools.vscode-docker`), container management

Recommended `settings.json` additions:

```json
{
    "[python]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff",

## Pre-commit Hooks

Install once with `make hooks`. The hooks run automatically on every `git commit`:

| Hook                                       | What it does                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ruff`                                     | Lints Python, auto-fixes what it can                    |
| `ruff-format`                              | Formats Python in place                                 |
| `trailing-whitespace`                      | Strips trailing whitespace                              |
| `end-of-file-fixer`                        | Ensures files end with a newline                        |
| `check-yaml` / `check-toml` / `check-json` | Validates config file syntax                            |
| `check-added-large-files`                  | Blocks files over 500KB                                 |
| `check-merge-conflict`                     | Blocks leftover `<<<<<<<` markers                       |
| `detect-private-key`                       | Scans for private key material                          |
| `no-commit-to-branch`                      | Blocks direct commits to `main`                         |
| `check-secrets`                            | Scans staged content for API keys, tokens, `.env` files |
| `check-migrations`                         | Validates Alembic migration chain integrity             |
| `spdx-update`                              | Adds your SPDX copyright line to staged files           |
| `hadolint-docker`                          | Lints Dockerfiles                                       |

If a hook fails, fix the reported issue and commit again. To bypass in an emergency (not recommended):

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "your message"
```
