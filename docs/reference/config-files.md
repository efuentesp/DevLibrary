# Config files

Every file Observal reads or writes on the client (`~/.observal/`) and in each harness's config directory.

## Client-side: `~/.observal/`

| File | Purpose | Permissions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config.json` | CLI config (server URL, access token, user info, timeout) | `0600` |
| `aliases.json` | User-defined shortcuts (`@my-mcp` → UUID) | `0600` |
| `last_results.json` | Latest typed list output, enabling row-number references | `0600` |
| `telemetry_buffer.db` | Durable SQLite outbox for Python session exporters awaiting contiguous server acknowledgement | `0600` |
| `opencode_session_outbox/` | Per-session durable OpenCode plugin batches and acknowledged line state | `0600` files |
| `pi_session_outbox/` | Durable pending Pi extension batches | `0600` files |
| `sync_state.json` | Acknowledged byte/line cursors for file-backed exporters | owner read/write |
| `keys/` | Server-side JWT keys (operators only; path controlled by `JWT_KEY_DIR`) | `0600` |

### `config.json` schema

```json
{
  "server_url": "https://observal.your-company.internal",
  "access_token": "ey...",
  "refresh_token": "ey...",
  "user_id": "f9f3...",
  "user_name": "Alice",
  "username": "alice",
  "timeout": 30,
  "update_check": true,
  "update_check_interval": 86400,
  "update_check_repo": ""
}
```

Authentication and identity fields are managed by `dev-library auth`. The `config set` command accepts only `server_url`, `timeout`, `update_check`, `update_check_interval`, and `update_check_repo`. Supported environment variables override persisted values for the current invocation; see [Environment variables](environment-variables.md).

### Durable session outbox

Python session exporters persist each observed batch in `telemetry_buffer.db` before network delivery. OpenCode and Pi use per-session files under their native outbox directories because their TypeScript runtimes cannot call the Python SQLite engine. All follow the same protocol: pending data survives process restarts and failed attempts, and the source line advances only when the server's contiguous checkpoint covers the complete batch. Observal does not silently evict unacknowledged records at capacity.

`sync_state.json` is a cache of acknowledged local positions, not the authority for delivered history. If it is missing, corrupt, or stale, recovery validates and restores positions from the authenticated server checkpoint. Finalized sessions also send a SHA-256 audit manifest; hashing is not performed on ordinary incremental uploads.

Use `dev-library ops telemetry status` to inspect pending batch count, disk use, oldest pending time, and last successful acknowledgement.

### `aliases.json` schema

```json
{
  "my-mcp": "498c17ac-1234-4567-89ab-cdef01234567",
  "reviewer": "alice/reviewer"
}
```

Use anywhere that accepts a compatible reference by prefixing the alias with `@`.

### `last_results.json` schema

```json
{
  "item_type": "skill",
  "ids": ["498c17ac-1234-4567-89ab-cdef01234567"],
  "names": {
    "reviewer": "498c17ac-1234-4567-89ab-cdef01234567"
  }
}
```

Each list invocation replaces this cache, including an empty result. Numeric row references are valid only for the component type that produced the latest list.

## Safe writes

`dev-library doctor patch` and `dev-library doctor cleanup` write each managed configuration file atomically and preserve unrelated entries. Use `--dry-run --output json` to review planned harness changes before writing. Agent Pull reports every created or merged file in its result.

## File permissions

Client-side files under `~/.observal/` are created with mode `0600` (owner read/write only). This holds your access token, so don't loosen the permissions.
