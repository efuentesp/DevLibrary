# Pi

Pi is a first-class Observal harness integration. Observal can install Pi agent
profiles, configure MCP servers, expose skills, install the telemetry extension,
and collect Pi session telemetry.

---

## Overview

Pi is harness-centric: the whole of Pi is one agent. There is no per-agent
profile file the way Kiro or OpenCode have one. Instead, Observal writes the
agent's rules into `AGENTS.md`, which becomes Pi's system prompt, and writes
MCP servers and skills next to it.

To let several registry agents coexist, a user-scope `dev-library agent pull`
writes each agent into its own profile directory under
`~/.pi/agent/agents/{agent}/`. The Observal extension's `/agent` command swaps a
profile into the live `~/.pi/agent/` location. A project-scope pull writes the
rules straight to the project's `AGENTS.md`, which Pi reads directly.

Pi session telemetry uses an in-process TypeScript extension,
`~/.pi/agent/extensions/observal.ts`. It is installed by `dev-library doctor patch`
and is shared by every agent; agent pulls do not embed telemetry hooks.

---

## Supported capabilities

| Capability | Support |
| --- | --- |
| Agent profiles | Project and user scope, as `AGENTS.md` |
| Hook bridge | Pi extension (no shell hooks) |
| Extension events | `session_start`, `agent_end`, `session_shutdown` |
| MCP servers | `.pi/mcp.json` and `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json` |
| Agent prompt | Registry rules are written into the generated `AGENTS.md` |
| Guidance files | Scanned from `AGENTS.md`, `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md`, `.pi/SYSTEM.md`, `.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` |
| Skills | `.pi/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` and `~/.pi/agent/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` |
| Session parsing | Pi JSONL parser |
| Telemetry | Pi session transcripts delivered through the extension; `dev-library reconcile --harness pi` is accepted but finds no sessions |
| Model selection | Registry-backed Pi model catalog (`dev-library registry models list --harness pi`) |

---

## Setup

### 1. Install the Observal CLI

```bash
uv tool install observal-cli
# or: pipx install observal-cli
```

Pi 0.74.0 or newer is required by the telemetry extension.

### 2. Authenticate

```bash
dev-library auth login
```

This writes credentials to `~/.observal/config.json`. Unless you pass
`--no-setup` or `--output json`, login then installs the bundled Observal skills
into every detected harness (Pi counts once `~/.pi/` exists) and runs
`dev-library doctor`, which warns if the Pi telemetry extension is missing or
stale. A healthy install prints no Pi warning.

### 3. Pull an agent into Pi

```bash
dev-library agent pull <agent-name> --harness pi
```

Pi's default scope is user scope. The agent is written to
`~/.pi/agent/agents/{agent-name}/`.

To install into the current project:

```bash
dev-library agent pull <agent-name> --harness pi --scope project
```

Project pulls write the rules to `AGENTS.md` in the project root, which Pi
reads directly, and the agent's MCP servers and skills to
`.pi/agents/{agent-name}/`. Pi loads project MCP servers from `.pi/mcp.json`
and project skills from `.pi/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`, and `/agent` handles only
user-scope profiles, so activate them by hand:

```bash
cp .pi/agents/<agent-name>/mcp.json .pi/mcp.json
cp -r .pi/agents/<agent-name>/skills/. .pi/skills/
```

Merge instead of copying if `.pi/mcp.json` already lists other servers.

### 4. Install or refresh the telemetry extension

```bash
dev-library doctor patch --harness pi
```

This writes the bundled extension to `~/.pi/agent/extensions/observal.ts` when
it is missing or differs from the bundled source, and removes any legacy
`npm:observal-pi` entry from `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` so the extension is
not loaded twice. Restart Pi or run `/reload` afterwards.

`doctor patch` refuses to run until `dev-library auth login` has written a server
URL, although it does not contact the server.

### 5. Activate the agent inside Pi

Inside a Pi session, run `/agent` and pick the pulled agent. See
[Agent profiles and swapping](#agent-profiles-and-swapping).

### 6. Check what is installed

```bash
dev-library scan --harness pi
dev-library doctor
```

| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent rules | `AGENTS.md` (project root) | `~/.pi/agent/agents/{agent}/AGENTS.md` |
| MCP config | `.pi/agents/{agent}/mcp.json` | `~/.pi/agent/agents/{agent}/mcp.json` |
| Skill definition | `.pi/agents/{agent}/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` | `~/.pi/agent/agents/{agent}/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` |
| Active agent rules | `AGENTS.md` | `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` |
| Active MCP config | `.pi/mcp.json` | `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json` |
| Active skills | `.pi/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` | `~/.pi/agent/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` |
| Guidance files | `AGENTS.md`, `.pi/SYSTEM.md`, `.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` | `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` |
| Telemetry extension | – | `~/.pi/agent/extensions/observal.ts` |
| Pi settings | – | `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` |
| Observal credentials | `~/.observal/config.json` | `~/.observal/config.json` |

## Agent profiles and swapping

Because Pi reads a single `AGENTS.md`, `mcp.json`, and `skills/` directory,
only one Observal agent can be active at a time. In user scope,
`dev-library agent pull` does not touch the active files. It writes into the
per-agent profile directory, and the extension's `/agent` command makes a
profile active:

1. On first use, `/agent` backs up the current `AGENTS.md`, `SYSTEM.md`,
   `mcp.json`, `skills/`, and `sandboxes/` into `~/.pi/agent/agents/default/`.
2. It removes the active `AGENTS.md`, `SYSTEM.md`, `mcp.json`, `skills/`, and
   `sandboxes/`, then copies in whichever of those the chosen profile contains.
   Items the profile lacks stay absent until you swap back to `default`.
3. When Observal credentials are configured, it records the chosen agent as
   `active_agent` in `~/.observal/config.json` and refreshes the layer
   snapshot.
4. It offers to reload the session so the new system prompt takes effect.

Run `/agent` with no argument to pick from installed profiles, or
`/agent <name>` to swap directly. Choose `default` to restore the backed-up
configuration and clear the active agent. `/agent` lists only user-scope
profiles under `~/.pi/agent/agents/`.

---

## Extension spec

Observal installs a TypeScript extension named `observal.ts`. It has no
runtime dependencies beyond `node:*` built-ins and is fail-open: telemetry
failures never interrupt Pi. Ingest and checkpoint calls time out after five
seconds, and the layer-snapshot upload after ten.

| Pi event | Observal use |
| --- | --- |
| `session_start` | Load config and cursors, upload the layer snapshot, recover stale sessions on startup, show `● observal` in the footer |
| `agent_end` | Push new session lines after each turn |
| `session_shutdown` | Push remaining lines and finalize the session |

The extension also registers two commands, `/agent` and `/obs-sync`:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/agent [name]` | Swap the active Observal agent profile |
| `/obs-sync` | Show lines pushed and the server URL |
| `/obs-sync flush` | Push pending lines now |
| `/obs-sync config` | Show the config file path and server URL |

`doctor patch` compares the installed file with the bundled source and replaces
stale copies.

---

## Attribution

Pi does not expose an Observal agent id in its session file. The extension
resolves attribution from Observal's own state:

1. `dev-library agent pull` records the agent name, id, version, scope, pull
   time, and directory under the `pi` harness in `~/.observal/lockfile.json`.
2. The pull also records that agent as `active_agent` in
   `~/.observal/config.json`, and `/agent` updates the entry whenever you
   swap profiles.
3. On `session_start`, the extension reads `active_agent` and looks it up in
   the lockfile entry for the configured server URL, matching by id first and
   then by name.
4. The session payload is sent with the resolved `agent_id` and
   `agent_version`.
5. If there is no `active_agent`, or it has no `id`, the session is sent with
   a null agent id.
   If there is an `active_agent` but no lockfile match, the stored id is sent
   as-is; no directory-based guessing takes place.

---

## Session push behavior

The Pi extension implements the same acknowledged delivery contract as the
Python harnesses:

1. Resolve the session JSONL file and id from Pi's session manager.
2. Read complete records after the acknowledged byte and line cursor in
   `~/.observal/sync_state.json`.
3. Persist each pending batch under `~/.observal/pi_session_outbox/` before
   network delivery, in chunks of at most 500 lines.
4. Retry the batch idempotently until the server returns a contiguous
   acknowledgement covering it.
5. Advance the local cursor only to that acknowledged checkpoint.
6. On `session_shutdown`, send a SHA-256 audit manifest and replay any range
   the server asks to repair.
7. On the next startup, retry every pending outbox batch, then re-push
   unfinished sessions from the current project that changed within the last
   seven days until five have been finalized. Attempts that fail do not count
   toward the five. A missing or corrupt cursor is rebuilt from the server
   checkpoint on the next push.

Pi's pending batches are the files under `~/.observal/pi_session_outbox/`.
`dev-library ops telemetry status` reports server ingest health and the Python
exporters' outbox; it does not count this directory.

---

## Agent profile format

Observal writes the agent's rules as plain Markdown into `AGENTS.md`. Pi loads
that file as the system prompt, so the whole file is the agent:

```markdown
# Reviewer

You are a code reviewer with the following specialization...
```

There is no frontmatter and no model field. `dev-library agent pull` does not
write a model into Pi's configuration; the model is chosen inside Pi.

---

## Skill file format

Pi skills live at:

| Scope | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Project | `.pi/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` |
| User | `~/.pi/agent/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` |

Example:

```markdown
---
description: "Runs the project test suite"
---

# Run Tests

Run `pytest -q` from the project root.
```

When Codex is also installed, the bundled Observal skills are written once to
the shared `~/.agents/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` location, which both harnesses
read, instead of being duplicated under `~/.pi/agent/skills/`.

## Caveats

**One active agent at a time.** A user-scope pull does not activate the
agent. Run `/agent` inside Pi, or copy the profile into `~/.pi/agent/` by hand.
`/agent` does not see project-scope profiles under `.pi/agents/`; copy their
`mcp.json` and `skills/` into `.pi/` as shown in Setup step 3.

**`/agent` replaces the active files.** The first swap backs up your existing
`AGENTS.md`, `SYSTEM.md`, `mcp.json`, `skills/`, and `sandboxes/` into the
`default` profile. Later swaps remove those five items and install only what
the chosen profile contains, so a profile without `SYSTEM.md` leaves Pi with no
`SYSTEM.md`. Edit the profile directory, not the active files, if you want
changes to survive a swap.

**The extension is shared per Pi install.** It is installed by `doctor patch`,
not by each agent pull, and lives only in user scope.

**Guidance files are scanned, with two exceptions.** Observal layers
`AGENTS.md`, `.pi/SYSTEM.md`, and `.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` as context. Scanning
and `dev-library agent pull` never rewrite the project's `.pi/SYSTEM.md` or
`.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md`. A project-scope pull does write the project's
`AGENTS.md`, because that file is the agent's rules in Pi, and `/agent` swaps
do replace the user-scope `~/.pi/agent/SYSTEM.md` as described above.

**Attribution depends on the lockfile and `/agent`.** A profile copied by hand
does not update `active_agent`, so its sessions keep whatever binding
`~/.observal/config.json` already holds, or carry no agent id if it has none.

**MCP config is Pi-specific.** Pi uses `mcp.json` with the `mcpServers` key
under `.pi/` or `~/.pi/agent/`, not Claude Code or Kiro MCP paths.
