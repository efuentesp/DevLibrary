## Test Matrix

The sections below must be run **twice**, once per configuration:

| Case | Global Tracing | Registered-Agents-Only | What it validates |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| **A** | ✅ On (default) | ❌ Off | All agent sessions are eligible for attribution regardless of registry status |
| **B** | ❌ Off | ✅ On | Only registered agents are attributed; unregistered session activity may remain unattributed |

> **How to switch:** Log in as Admin → Settings → toggle "Registered Agents Only". The toggle affects new session ingestion.

Run sections 20–30 once with Case A, then reset and repeat with Case B.

---

- [ ] Switch to Admin → verify Admin can still see all users' traces
- [ ] Switch to Admin → disable trace privacy
- [ ] Switch to User B → verify User B can now see other users' traces again

---

---

## 25. User B - Pull Updated Agent & Verify New Version

- [ ] Log in as User B via CLI (`dev-library auth login`)
- [ ] Run `dev-library agent pull <agent-slug> --harness <harness>` (note: command moved from `dev-library pull`)
- [ ] Verify the pulled config reflects the NEW version's changes (updated model, components, etc.)
- [ ] Verify per-agent hooks are installed correctly for the chosen harness
- [ ] Verify download count increments
- [ ] Use the pulled agent in an harness → generate a trace
- [ ] Verify the trace shows the correct agent version (agent name should reflect the new version)

---

## 26. User A - Edit & Resubmit Rejected Items

- [ ] Log in as User A

- [ ] Switch to Admin → verify traces only exist for registered agent activity

---

## 28. User A - Edit Pending Submissions (Edit Lock)

> PR #712 / Issue #663: Owners can edit/delete pending items. Editing acquires a 30-min lock that hides the item from the review queue.

### Edit a pending component while in review queue (UI)

- [ ] Log in as User A
- [ ] Submit a new component (or use one already pending from earlier sections)
- [ ] Switch to Reviewer B → verify the pending item appears in review queue
- [ ] Switch back to User A → open the pending component → click Edit
- [ ] Verify edit lock is acquired (item shows "editing" state)
- [ ] Switch to Reviewer B → verify the item has **disappeared** from the review queue
- [ ] Switch back to User A → save edits
- [ ] Switch to Reviewer B → verify the item **reappears** in the review queue

### Edit a pending agent while in review queue (UI)

- [ ] Log in as User A
- [ ] Navigate to a pending agent → open agent builder / edit page
- [ ] Verify edit lock is acquired on mount
- [ ] Switch to Reviewer A → run `dev-library admin review list` → verify agent is NOT listed
- [ ] Switch back to User A → save edits
- [ ] Switch to Reviewer A → run `dev-library admin review list` → verify agent reappears

### Edit pending items via CLI

- [ ] Log in as User A via CLI
- [ ] Run edit command for a pending component (e.g. `dev-library skill edit <slug>`)
- [ ] Verify start-edit lock is acquired (check review queue from another session)
- [ ] Complete the edit → verify cancel-edit releases the lock

### Edge cases

- [ ] As Reviewer B, open a pending component and begin reviewing it → switch to User A → try to edit that same component → verify User A is blocked (banner shown: "item is being reviewed")
- [ ] As Reviewer A, open a pending agent in CLI review → switch to User A → try to edit that agent → verify User A is blocked
- [ ] Reverse: User A starts editing a pending component (lock acquired) → switch to Reviewer B → verify item is gone from review queue (cannot review what's being edited)
- [ ] As Reviewer B, try to approve/reject a component that User A is currently editing → verify 409 error
- [ ] Close browser tab while editing a pending item → verify lock releases (item reappears in queue after page close or 30-min TTL expiry)
- [ ] Delete a pending component from My Submissions → verify it disappears from review queue permanently

---

## 29. Auth - Token Revocation Stops Traces

- [ ] Log in as User B via CLI (`dev-library auth login`)
- [ ] Use an harness with an agent → verify traces are being captured
- [ ] Run `dev-library auth logout`
- [ ] Use the same harness with the same agent → generate activity
- [ ] Verify **no new traces** appear (token revoked server-side, telemetry rejected)

---

## 30. CLI Compatibility Checks

- [ ] With an outdated CLI version, run any command → verify warning about CLI version being older than server requires
- [ ] Verify `dev-library agent pull` works (not the old `dev-library pull` which no longer exists)
