# Adding a New Harness to Observal

This guide covers everything needed to add full harness support. Observal manages
four component types per harness: **MCP servers**, **skills**, **hooks**, and
**sandboxes**. Each harness needs scanning (discovery), config generation (install),
hook instrumentation (telemetry), and session parsing (reconciliation).

## Overview: What "Supporting a harness" Means

When a user runs `observal agent pull <agent>`, Observal writes harness-specific files:

| Component | What gets written | Example |
| ----------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| MCP servers | Native JSON/TOML config with direct commands or URLs | `.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Skills | Markdown skill files in harness's skill directory | `.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md` |
| Hooks | Telemetry hook config that fires on tool use, session start/stop | `settings.json` hooks section |
| Sandboxes | MCP entry pointing to `observal-sandbox-run` | Added to MCP config |

When a user runs `observal scan`, Observal reads those same locations to discover what's installed.

## File Checklist

| # | File | What it does |
| --- | ------ | ------------- |
| 1 | `packages/observal-shared/observal_shared/harness_registry.py` | Shared harness metadata: paths, keys, event maps, formats |
| 2 | `dev_library_cli/harness/<harness_name>.py` | CLI adapter: scanning, hook detection, session source resolution/discovery, managed file attribution |
| 3 | `dev_library_cli/harness/load_all.py` | Add import line for auto-registration |
| 4 | `dev_library_cli/harness/__init__.py` | Adapter registry and protocol validation |
| 5 | `observal-server/services/harness/<harness_name>.py` | Server adapter: config generation for install |
| 6 | `observal-server/services/harness/load_all.py` | Add import line for server adapter |
| 7 | `dev_library_cli/harness_specs/<harness_name>_hooks_spec.py` | Hook spec: what hooks to install, event names |
| 8 | `dev_library_cli/sessions/<harness_name>.py` | Session parser (if harness writes JSONL sessions) |
| 9 | `dev_library_cli/hooks/<harness_name>_session_push.py` | Session push hook script |
| 10 | `dev_library_cli/cmd_doctor.py` | Doctor diagnose, patch, and cleanup implementations for the new harness |
| 11 | `dev_library_cli/layer.py` | Layer scanning globs (`HARNESS_LAYER_CONFIGS`) and active harness detection |
| 12 | `tests/test_cli_harness_adapters.py` | Adapter unit tests |
| 13 | `/api/v1/config/harnesses` consumers | Frontend uses server harness metadata through `useHarnesses()` |

## Step 1: Research the harness

Before writing code, document these for the target harness:

**MCP configuration:**

- Where does the harness look for MCP server config? (path, format: JSON/TOML/YAML)
- What's the top-level key? (`mcpServers`, `servers`, `mcp`, etc.)
- Does it support stdio, SSE, or both transports?
- Home-level config path vs project-level config path?

**Skills:**

- Does the harness have a skill/rules/instruction file concept?
- What format? (Markdown with YAML frontmatter, plain markdown, MDC, JSON)
- Where do skill files live? (project path, user/global path)

**Hooks:**

- Does the harness fire lifecycle events? (tool use, session start/stop, errors)
- How are hooks registered? (JSON config, settings file, plugin system)
- What events are available? Map them to Observal's canonical events:
  - `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`, `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `SubagentStop`
- Does the harness support command hooks, HTTP hooks, or plugin hooks?

**Sessions:**

- Does the harness write session logs? (JSONL, SQLite, custom format)
- Where are session files stored?
- What's the schema? (messages, tool calls, thinking blocks)

**Sandboxes:**

- Sandboxes are delivered as MCP servers, so if MCP works, sandboxes work.

## Step 2: Add Harness Registry Entry

Add one entry to `packages/observal-shared/observal_shared/harness_registry.py`.
Both the CLI and server import this shared registry.

```python
"my-harness": {
    "display_name": "My harness",
    "capabilities": {"hooks", "mcp_servers", "skills"},
    "session_parser": "my_harness",       # or None
    "scopes": ["project", "user"],
    "default_scope": "project",
    "scope_labels": ("project (.my-harness/)", "user (~/.my-harness/)"),

    # MCP config
    "mcp_config": {
        "project": ".my-harness/mcp.json",
        "user": "~/.my-harness/mcp.json",
    },
    "mcp_servers_key": "mcpServers",
    "home_mcp_config": "~/.my-harness/mcp.json",

    # Skills
    "skills": {
        "project": ".my-harness/skills/{name}/SKILL.md",
        "user": "~/.my-harness/skills/{name}/SKILL.md",
    },
    "skill_format": "yaml_frontmatter",

    # Rules/Agent files
    "agent_profile": {
        "project": ".my-harness/agents/{name}.md",
        "user": "~/.my-harness/agents/{name}.md",
    },
    "agent_profile_format": "yaml_frontmatter",

    # Hooks
    "hook_type": "command",           # "command", "http", or "plugin"
    "hooks": {
        "project": ".my-harness/settings.json",
        "user": "~/.my-harness/settings.json",
    },
    "hook_scripts_dir": ".my-harness/hooks",
    "hook_events_map": {
        "PreToolUse": "preToolUse",
        "PostToolUse": "postToolUse",
        "Stop": "sessionEnd",
        "SessionStart": "sessionStart",
        "UserPromptSubmit": "beforeSubmitPrompt",
    },

    "config_dir": ".my-harness",
}
```

## Step 2.5: Update Doctor and Layer Scan (required)

Before moving on, always wire the new harness into these shared paths:

- `dev_library_cli/cmd_doctor.py`:
  - Add `_check_<harness>()`, `_patch_<harness>()`, and `_cleanup_<harness>()` implementations
- `dev_library_cli/harness/<harness_name>.py`:
  - Delegate `patch_hooks()` and `cleanup_hooks()` to those implementations
- `dev_library_cli/layer.py`:
  - Add user/project file globs under `HARNESS_LAYER_CONFIGS`
- `dev_library_cli/harness/<harness_name>.py`:
  - Add `home_markers` for active harness detection when the harness has a reliable home config marker. Glob patterns are supported.
  - Add `managed_agent_profiles`, `managed_skills`, and `managed_mcp_files` patterns for layer source attribution
  - Override `get_observal_managed_files()` only if simple `{name}` patterns are not enough

If these are skipped, the harness can appear supported in pull/scan while doctor and layer observability remain incomplete.

## Step 3: Create CLI Adapter (Scanning)

Create `dev_library_cli/harness/my_harness.py`. This handles local discovery:

register_adapter(MyHarnessAdapter())
```

## Step 4: Create Server-Side Config Generator (Install)

Create `observal-server/services/harness/my_harness.py`. This generates files when
users run `observal agent pull` or install an agent:

```python
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2026 Your Name <your@email.com>
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

"""My harness server-side config generator."""

from __future__ import annotations

from services.harness import BaseHarnessAdapter, ConfigContext, register_adapter


class MyHarnessAdapter(BaseHarnessAdapter):
    @property
    def harness_name(self) -> str:
        return "my-harness"

    def format_config(self, ctx: ConfigContext) -> dict:
        """Generate the complete install response for this harness."""
        return {
            "agent_profile": {
                "path": f".my-harness/agents/{ctx.safe_name}.md",
                "content": ctx.rules_content,
            },
            "mcp_config": {
                "path": ".my-harness/mcp.json",
                "content": {"mcpServers": ctx.mcp_configs},
            },
        }


register_adapter(MyHarnessAdapter())
```

## Step 5: Create Hook Spec

Create `dev_library_cli/harness_specs/my_harness_hooks_spec.py`. This defines what
hooks `observal doctor patch` installs:

```python
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2026 Your Name <your@email.com>
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

"""Hook specification for My harness."""


def build_hooks() -> dict:
    """Return the hooks config to merge into the harness's settings.

    This is called by doctor patch and by the adapter's generate_hook_config().
    The format must match what the harness expects in its hook config file.
    """
    return {
        "hooks": {
            "preToolUse": [
                {
                    "type": "command",
                    "command": "python -m dev_library_cli.hooks.session_push --harness my-harness",
                }
            ],
            "postToolUse": [
                {
                    "type": "command",
                    "command": "python -m dev_library_cli.hooks.session_push --harness my-harness",
                }
            ],
            "sessionEnd": [
                {
                    "type": "command",
                    "command": "python -m dev_library_cli.hooks.session_push --harness my-harness",
                }
            ],
        }
    }
```

## Step 6: Add the Session Source Adapter and Parser (required)

Transport and parsing are intentionally separate. The CLI adapter locates raw source records; it must not normalize them. The server parser remains harness-specific and converts stored raw rows into frontend events.

For a JSONL harness, implement the session methods on the existing `HarnessAdapter` in `dev_library_cli/harness/my_harness.py`:

```python
def resolve_session_source(self, event: dict, home: Path | None = None) -> SessionSource | None:
    # Resolve the exact session ID, source path, cwd, and optional parent ID.
    ...

def discover_session_sources(self, home: Path | None = None, since_hours: int = 168) -> list[SessionSource]:
    # Used by background recovery and `observal reconcile`.
    ...

def is_session_final(self, event: dict) -> bool:
    ...
```

Use `related_session_sources()` for separately stored subagents, `session_extra_fields()` for durable metadata such as credits, and `session_extra_records()` only for actual synthetic source records. Reuse `dev_library_cli.hooks.session_push --harness my-harness`; create a bridge module only when the host requires special stdout or runtime behavior. Do not add another cursor, direct POST path, or harness-specific reconcile scanner.

The shared engine reads complete records, spools them before network delivery, retries stable source indexes, advances only after a contiguous acknowledgement, recovers from the server checkpoint, and hashes full history only during final audit.

Implement the independent server parser in `observal-server/services/session_parsers/my_harness.py`. It should handle user and assistant messages, tool calls/results, reasoning blocks, errors, and boundaries. Register it in `observal-server/services/session_parsers/__init__.py`; the harness registry's `session_parser` value must match its ID.

For a non-JSONL host, add a native source/exporter only when the supported harness actually requires one. It must persist pending indexed records before delivery and obey the same acknowledgement/checkpoint/final-hash protocol. OpenCode and Pi are the reference native implementations.

## Step 7: Configure the Shared Session Hook

Point generated hook commands at:

```text
python -m dev_library_cli.hooks.session_push --harness my-harness
```

A thin compatibility bridge is acceptable for required host responses, but all recovery and delivery still route through the shared engine.

## Step 8: Register Everything

1. `dev_library_cli/harness/load_all.py`:

   ```python
   from dev_library_cli.harness import my_harness as _my_harness  # noqa: F401
   ```

2. `dev_library_cli/harness/<harness_name>.py`: set `home_markers` and managed file attribution patterns used by layer snapshots.

3. `observal-server/services/harness/load_all.py`:

   ```python
   from services.harness import my_harness as _my_harness  # noqa: F401
   ```

4. `dev_library_cli/cmd_scan.py`: add to `_HARNESS_HOME_DIRS`:

   ```python
   "my-harness": "~/.my-harness",
   ```

## Step 9: Tests

Minimum test coverage required:

```python
class TestMyHarnessAdapter:
    def test_scan_home_empty(self, tmp_path):
        adapter = MyHarnessAdapter()
        result = adapter.scan_home(tmp_path)
        assert result.mcps == []
        assert result.skills == []

    def test_is_installed_uses_home_marker(self, tmp_path):
        adapter = MyHarnessAdapter()
        assert adapter.is_installed(tmp_path) is False
        (tmp_path / ".my-harness").mkdir()
        assert adapter.is_installed(tmp_path) is True

    def test_scan_home_discovers_mcps(self, tmp_path):
        harness_dir = tmp_path / ".my-harness"
        harness_dir.mkdir()
        (harness_dir / "mcp.json").write_text('{"mcpServers": {"srv": {"command": "npx"}}}')
        adapter = MyHarnessAdapter()
        result = adapter.scan_home(tmp_path)
        assert len(result.mcps) == 1
        assert result.mcps[0].name == "srv"

    def test_scan_home_discovers_skills(self, tmp_path):
        skill_dir = tmp_path / ".my-harness" / "skills" / "my-skill"
        skill_dir.mkdir(parents=True)
        (skill_dir / "SKILL.md").write_text("---\ndescription: Does stuff\n---\n")
        adapter = MyHarnessAdapter()
        result = adapter.scan_home(tmp_path)
        assert len(result.skills) == 1

    def test_scan_project_discovers_mcps(self, tmp_path):
        (tmp_path / ".my-harness").mkdir()
        (tmp_path / ".my-harness" / "mcp.json").write_text('{"mcpServers": {"p": {"command": "node"}}}')
        adapter = MyHarnessAdapter()
        result = adapter.scan_project(tmp_path)
        assert len(result.mcps) == 1

    def test_detect_hooks_missing(self, tmp_path):
        adapter = MyHarnessAdapter()
        assert adapter.detect_hooks(tmp_path) == "missing"

    def test_detect_hooks_installed(self, tmp_path):
        (tmp_path / "settings.json").write_text(json.dumps({
            "hooks": {
                "preToolUse": [{"command": "python -m dev_library_cli.hooks.session_push --harness my-harness"}],
                "postToolUse": [{"command": "python -m dev_library_cli.hooks.session_push --harness my-harness"}],
                "sessionEnd": [{"command": "python -m dev_library_cli.hooks.session_push --harness my-harness"}],
            }
        }))
        adapter = MyHarnessAdapter()
        assert adapter.detect_hooks(tmp_path) == "installed"

    def test_managed_files_for_layer_source_attribution(self):
        lockfile = {
            "harnesses": {
                "my-harness": {
                    "agents": [{"name": "agent-one", "components": [{"type": "skill", "name": "helper"}]}],
                }
            }
        }
        adapter = MyHarnessAdapter()
        assert adapter.get_observal_managed_files(lockfile) == {
            "user:agents/agent-one.md",
            "project:.my-harness/agents/agent-one.md",
            "user:skills/helper/SKILL.md",
            "project:.my-harness/skills/helper/SKILL.md",
        }
```

## Step 10: Verify

```bash
# Constants in sync

## Architecture Notes

**Skills are mostly universal.** All harnesses that support skills use the same
pattern: a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (or plain markdown) placed
in the harness's skill directory. The only things that vary are the directory path
(defined in `skill` in the registry) and the frontmatter format (defined
in `skill_format`). No harness-specific skill generation code is needed beyond
setting those two registry fields correctly. The shared `generate_skill()`
in `services/config/skill_builder.py` handles all harnesses.

**Sandboxes are just MCP servers.** They use `observal-sandbox-run` as the
command. If MCP install works for your harness, sandboxes work automatically.
No additional sandbox-specific code is needed per harness.

Other notes:

- Adapters are self-contained: one file handles scanning, hook detection, session source discovery, and managed file attribution
- Server parsers remain format-specific; transport, recovery, acknowledgement, and final audit behavior stay shared
- Shared utilities in `dev_library_cli/shared/utils.py`: `extract_mcp_servers`, `parse_frontmatter_field`, `_OBSERVAL_HOOK_MARKERS`
- `BaseAdapter` in `dev_library_cli/harness/base.py` provides feature-gating via `_check_feature()`
- `ensure_loaded()` guarantees all adapters are registered before cross-adapter operations
- MCP deduplication in scan uses first-discovered-wins
- MCP commands and remote URLs are emitted directly in each harness's native format
- Sandboxes are MCP servers backed by `observal-sandbox-run`, so if MCP install works, sandboxes work automatically
- Skills use the harness's native skill/rule file format, resolved from `skill` and `skill_format` in the registry
