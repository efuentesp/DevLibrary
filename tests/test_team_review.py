"""Tests for the team-scoped review queue at /api/v1/review.

Every route in api/routes/review.py used to sit behind require_role(UserRole.reviewer),
the GLOBAL role, which produced two defects at once:

1. A team-private item published by a plain team member landed in the global queue,
   where only a reviewer outside the team could approve it. Team-private titles were
   routed to outsiders and the team stayed blocked until one of them acted.
2. The "reviewer" team role granted no review capability whatsoever. A team owner and
   a team reviewer both got 403 on the queue and on approve.

Review is now capability scoped. The queue, the detail view, and the approve and
reject actions all read one ReviewScope, so the list and the actions cannot drift
apart: whatever a caller cannot see in the queue, they also cannot approve.

Team roles may review public content only after the teamspace itself passes global
public-visibility review. That approval is the trust boundary allowing its owners and
team reviewers to decide all later team content, including their own submissions.
