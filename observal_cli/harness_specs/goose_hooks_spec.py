"""Goose hook specification for session telemetry.

Goose follows the Open Plugins hooks spec: hooks are declared by a plugin
directory that goose discovers from ``~/.agents/plugins/<name>/`` (user) or
``<project>/.agents/plugins/<name>/`` (project).  Each plugin carries a
``plugin.json`` manifest and a ``hooks/hooks.json`` file::

    {"hooks": {"<Event>": [{"hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "...", "timeout": 30}]}]}}

Omitting ``matcher`` runs the rule for every event of that type; ``matcher`` is
a regular expression, so a bare ``"*"`` would be silently skipped by goose.

Events used for telemetry:
  SessionStart      establishes the session boundary
  UserPromptSubmit  flushes newly persisted rows at the start of a turn
  Stop              flushes the turn once goose finishes it
  SessionEnd        final flush and integrity audit

The hook command never writes to stdout, so goose's ``PreToolUse``/``Stop``
block signals are never triggered and telemetry can never deny a tool call.
