# AGENTS.md

Internal context for contributors and AI coding agents. Use `README.md` for the public API reference, `SETUP.md` for environment setup, and `docs/adding-a-harness.md` for harness integration.

## What Observal is

Observal is an agent-centric registry and observability platform for AI coding agents. Users interact with it three ways:

1. **CLI** (`observal`): pull agents, sca harnesses, submit components, manage the server
2. **Web UI** (`web/`): browse the registry, view traces, manage users, admin dashboard
3. **Observal skill** (bundled, auto-installed on login): lets the LLM inside any harness drive Observal commands directly (e.g. "create an agent that uses the github MCP")

Agents are the primary entity. Each agent bundles 5 component types: MCP servers, skills, hooks, prompts, and sandboxes. When a user runs `observal agent pull <agent>`, the platform resolves all components and writes harness-specific config files.

## harness capability support

Ten harnesses are registered in `packages/observal-shared/observal_shared/harness_registry.py`. Support is per-capability, not a single tier. Verify against the registry before relying on this table.

| Harness | Hook spec | Session parser | Capabilities | Harness-specific e2e |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | yes | `claude-code` | hooks, mcp_servers, skills | no |
| Kiro | yes | `kiro` | hooks, mcp_servers | yes (9 specs) |
| Cursor | no | `cursor` | hooks, mcp_servers | no |
| Pi | no | `pi` | hooks, mcp_servers, skills | no |
| Codex CLI | yes | `codex` | hooks, mcp_servers, skills | no |
| Copilot | yes | `copilot-cli` (shared) | hooks, mcp_servers, skills, prompts | no |
| Copilot CLI | yes | `copilot-cli` | hooks, mcp_servers, skills, prompts | no |
| OpenCode | yes | `opencode` | hooks, mcp_servers, skills | no |
| Antigravity | yes | `antigravity` | hooks, mcp_servers, skills | no |
| Goose | yes | `goose` | hooks, mcp_servers, skills | no |

Every harness now resolves a session parser, so `observal reconcile` works across all ten. Hook specs in `dev_library_cli/harness_specs/` exist for eight; Cursor and Pi have none. Only Kiro has harness-specific Playwright coverage.

See `docs/adding-a-harness.md` for the complete guide to adding or promoting a harness.

```

## How the modularisation works

The codebase follows a strict adapter pattern for harness-specific logic. This is the most important architectural decision:

**One adapter per harness, on both sides.** CLI adapters handle scanning and hook detection (`dev_library_cli/harness/<name>.py`). Server adapters handle config file generation (`observal-server/services/harness/<name>.py`). The shared harness registry (`packages/observal-shared/observal_shared/harness_registry.py`) defines paths, keys, features, and event maps for both sides.

**No if/elif chains for harness logic.** If you need harness-specific behavior, it goes in the adapter. The orchestrators (`cmd_scan.py`, `agent_builder.py`, `cmd_doctor.py`) call adapters via the registry, never with conditionals.

**Capability gating.** Each adapter method maps to a capability via `METHOD_FEATURE_MAP` in `dev_library_cli/harness/protocol.py`. The registry entry's `capabilities` set (`hooks`, `mcp_servers`, `skills`, `prompts`) decides what is allowed; `BaseAdapter` raises `NotSupportedError` when the capability is absent. This means stubs are safe: they exist but can't be called for unsupported operations.

**Session parsers are separate from adapters.** They live in `services/session_parsers/` (server-side) and handle converting raw JSONL into normalized trace events. All nine harnesses resolve a parser; Copilot reuses the Copilot CLI parser.

### What full support means concretely

A fully supported harness has all of:

- A hook spec in `harness_specs/` (defines what `doctor patch` installs)
- A session parser resolved from the registry's `session_parser` key (enables `observal reconcile`)
- Full scanning implementation in its CLI adapter (discovers MCPs, skills, hooks, agents)
- E2E test coverage in `tests/e2e/`

Today only Kiro meets all four. A minimal harness has:

- A registry entry with correct paths
- A CLI adapter that handles basic MCP scanning
- A server adapter that generates config files
- No hook spec and no e2e tests

## Coding patterns we prefer

### Python (server + CLI)

- **Ruff** for lint and format. Line length 120. Pre-commit enforces it.
- **Loguru for dev logging** (`from loguru import logger as optic`). Positional args only: `optic.debug("x={}", x)`. Never f-strings. Never `exc_info=` (loguru ignores it). See the Optic section below for the full rule and known exceptions.
- **Typer for CLI.** `B008` suppressed because Typer requires function calls in argument defaults.
- **Skill files track CLI changes.** When any CLI command is added, removed, renamed, or has its flags changed, update the corresponding skill files in `dev_library_cli/skills/`. These are the agent's source of truth for command syntax.
- **Dynamic settings** for runtime config: `from services.dynamic_settings import get, get_int, get_bool`. Non-boot settings live in the DB, not env vars.
- **ClickHouse migrations** live in `observal-server/clickhouse/migrations/*.sql` and run through `services.clickhouse.migrations`. Keep Alembic for Postgres only. Never add ClickHouse DDL to startup code. The init container runs ClickHouse migrations after Alembic and before API startup.
- **SSRF guard** for all outbound network: `from services.ssrf_guard import is_private_url`. Used in webhooks, git clone, MCP analysis.
- **Conventional Commits**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`. Scope in parens. No fixup commits (amend instead).

### TypeScript (web)

Vite 6 SPA with TanStack Router, not Next.js. `web/AGENTS.md` is the authoritative frontend reference; the rules below are the short form.

- **Auth storage is split.** `observal_access_token` lives in sessionStorage; `observal_refresh_token` and cached profile fields (role, name, email, username, avatar) live in localStorage so refresh survives reloads and new tabs. Do not widen localStorage use without changing the auth model deliberately.
- **TanStack Query hooks** from `use-api.ts` for all data fetching. Raw `fetch` in components is a known exception, not a pattern: a handful of call sites (co-authors, edit-lock release via `keepalive`, logout, SAML exchange) still use it. Do not add more.
- **Types centralized** in `src/lib/types.ts` (a barrel over `src/lib/types/`). No inline API response types.
- **harness list from server** (`/api/v1/config/harnesses`), never hardcoded in frontend.
- **OKLCH color tokens** in `src/app.css`. No raw hex/rgb in components.

### General

- **No telemetry wrappers or OTLP env vars.** MCP commands and remote URLs remain direct. Telemetry flows through session push hooks and reconciliation. Never generate `OTEL_*` or `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY` vars.
- **Owner fallback on install.** Submitters can install their own items without admin approval. Approved items are preferred, but pending/rejected items are accessible to the submitter.
- **Canonical registry identity is `namespace/slug`.** UUIDs remain accepted; legacy bare names resolve only when unambiguous. CLI slash-qualified references resolve to UUIDs before using existing action routes.
- **Hard rewrite policy.** No deprecation wrappers. When code moves, callers update in the same PR. Dead code is deleted immediately.
- **Tests mock externals.** No Docker needed to run the test suite. E2E specs in `tests/e2e/` are the exception (require running stack).

`pull` is a subcommand (`observal agent pull`), not a top-level command. Run `observal --help` to confirm before documenting a command path.

## Server routes

REST at `/api/v1/`. GraphQL at `/api/v1/graphql` (read-only telemetry layer with subscriptions).

Key route files: `auth.py`, `mcp.py`, `skill.py`, `hook.py`, `prompt.py`, `sandbox.py`, `review.py`, `feedback.py`, `dashboard.py`, `insights.py`, `reconcile.py`, `ingest.py`, `telemetry.py`, `alert.py`, `config.py`, `sessions.py`, `device_auth.py`, `jwks.py`, `component_source.py`, `component_versions.py`, `agent_versions.py`, `bulk.py`, `support.py`, `preview.py`, `audit.py`, `registry_models.py`.

Sub-packages: `agent/` (crud, install, draft), `admin/` (enterprise_settings, users, org, retention).

## Database architecture

- **PostgreSQL**: relational data (users, agents, components, feedback, settings). SQLAlchemy async.
- **ClickHouse**: session events, session aggregates, audit events, security events, and webhook deliveries. HTTP interface, MergeTree-family tables, bloom filter indexes. Schema changes use versioned SQL migrations in `observal-server/clickhouse/migrations/`. Runtime helpers stay in `services/clickhouse/`.
- **Redis**: pub/sub for GraphQL subscriptions, arq job queue, dynamic settings cache, auth token revocation.

## Telemetry pipeline

```
harness ──→ session push hooks ──→ POST /api/v1/ingest/session ──→ ClickHouse
CLI ──→ observal reconcile ──→ POST /api/v1/ingest/session ──→ ClickHouse
```

Session delivery uses a local outbox and resumes after transient network failures.

## Auth model

- JWT bearer tokens. `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every authenticated request. There is no `X-API-Key` path.
- JWT signing uses ES256 (not HS256). JWKS endpoint for public key distribution.
- Device authorization flow for CLI login via browser confirmation.
- Redis fail-closed: if Redis is down, auth fails (prevents stale token usage).
- Fresh servers auto-bootstrap admin on first `observal auth login` (localhost-only).

## Commands

```bash
# Docker stack (10 services: init, api, db, clickhouse, redis, worker, web, lb, prometheus, grafana)
make up                  # start
make down                # stop
make rebuild             # rebuild and restart
make logs                # tail logs

# CLI (installed via uv)
uv tool install --editable .
observal auth login      # auto-creates admin on fresh server, or login
observal auth whoami     # check auth

# Linting
make lint                # ruff check
make format              # ruff format + ruff fix
make check               # pre-commit on all files
make hooks               # install pre-commit hooks

# Tests (all mock externals, no Docker needed)
make test                # runs tests/ only (174 files), parallel via pytest-xdist
make test-v              # verbose
# observal-server/tests/ (21 files) and dev_library_cli/tests/ (11 files) are not run
# by `make test` or CI; invoke pytest on those paths directly.
make test-fuzz           # smoke-test the OSS-Fuzz targets in fuzz/ (needs atheris)
# E2E (requires running stack):
cd tests/e2e && pnpm test   # 20 Playwright specs
```

## Optic (dev logging)

Loguru-based. `observal ops logs` streams `~/.observal/logs/dev.log`.

- Import: `from loguru import logger as optic`
- Format: `optic.debug("msg: x={}", x)` (positional only, never f-strings)
- **Never pass `exc_info=`.** Loguru ignores it, so the traceback is silently dropped and `exc_info` lands in `extra` as a literal. Use `optic.exception(...)` or `optic.opt(exception=True).error(...)`.
- **Avoid structlog-style keyword args** (`optic.info("event_name", key=value)`). Loguru does not interpolate them into the message; they land in `record["extra"]`. The stderr and file sinks render `{message}` only, so those values are invisible in `docker logs` and `dev.log` — only the ring-buffer sink (SSE `/admin/logs/stream`, support bundle) retains them. About 30 legacy call sites still do this (`jobs/catalog.py`, `services/dynamic_settings.py`, `services/insights/self_learn.py`, `services/strategic_insights.py`, `api/routes/{dashboard,insights}.py`); convert them when you touch them, don't add new ones.
- Never log secrets, tokens, keys, JWT payloads. Log IDs and counts only.
- Log format (console/json) configured via `observability.log_format` dynamic setting.
- `logging_config.py` configures a separate structlog pipeline used by parts of the insights engine. Loguru (`optic`) is the default for new code.

## AI contribution policy

See `AI_POLICY.md`. Key rules: no autonomous PRs without human authorship, every change must be explainable, label AI tool usage, frontend changes need screenshots, no slop.
