Use when the user asks to reconcile missed sessions, repair CLI version state, or continue locally after a confirmed connection or configuration failure."

# Recovering DevLibrary

## Execution contract

1. Execute commands with a 60 second timeout unless the operation documents a longer wait.
2. **Use machine output by default:** add `--output json` whenever supported. Parse list results from `items` and pagination fields.
3. Run `--help` before acting when a path or flag is uncertain.
4. Use dry run before reconciliation when scope or session volume is uncertain.
5. Supply documented force flags so version operations never prompt.
6. Verify cursor, outbox, installed version, checksum, and rollback state after recovery operations.
7. Fail openly. Never hide an unavailable server behind automatic local writes.
8. Never retry reconciliation, version changes, or fallback writes without checking resulting state.

Read [Recovery workflows](references/recovery-workflows.md) completely before executing.

## Decision rules

- Healthy telemetry does not need routine reconciliation.
- Reconcile repairs missed local session delivery. It does not replace hook or extension installation.
- Upgrade, downgrade, and rollback are distinct requests. Do not substitute one for another.
- Local fallback is allowed only after the CLI explicitly reports `Connection failed` or `Not configured`, and only when the user still wants local files written.
- Local fallback creates harness-native Agent files. It does not publish Registry state and must be reported as local-only.
- Never invent telemetry environment variables or wrappers.

## Completion

Report sessions discovered, queued, skipped, or failed for reconciliation; old and new versions for CLI changes; or exact local paths for fallback. Include unresolved warnings and the command needed once the server is reachable.
