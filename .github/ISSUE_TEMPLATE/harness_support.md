## Background

[Describe the harness, where it runs, and why Observal should support it. Link to the official product page.]

## Before you pick this up

Only take this issue if you are willing to use the harness as a daily driver for a while, properly test the integration, help maintain support for the runtime, and write proper documentation for it.

## Implementation guide

Follow [docs/adding-a-harness.md](https://github.com/Observal/Observal/blob/main/docs/adding-a-harness.md) for the full file checklist and step-by-step process. Start with Step 1, Research the harness, using the official documentation to determine config paths, MCP format, hook support, and session log locations.

## Scope

[Describe the expected harness support, including MCP servers, skills, prompts or guidelines, hooks, custom agents, and session parsing. Call out unknowns that require research.]

> **Note:** PRs without screenshots showing traces and installed Observal components working in the harness will be automatically closed.

## Relevant docs found so far

[Link the official documentation for configuration, MCP servers, skills, hooks, custom agents, and session storage.]

## File checklist

See [docs/adding-a-harness.md, File Checklist](https://github.com/Observal/Observal/blob/main/docs/adding-a-harness.md#file-checklist) for the full list.

[List any harness-specific files or changes discovered during research.]

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `observal pull <agent> --harness <name>` writes correct config and the agent is usable in the harness.
- [ ] `observal scan --harness <name>` discovers installed components.
- [ ] MCP servers are installable and functional within the harness.
- [ ] Skills are installable and functional within the harness.
- [ ] Guidelines are written to a documented harness-compatible location.
- [ ] Custom agents are scanned or generated when supported by the adapter.
- [ ] Hooks fire correctly on supported lifecycle events, or unsupported hooks are documented clearly.
- [ ] Sessions are traced with a working session parser, or the PR documents why session parsing is not possible.
- [ ] `observal doctor` reports the harness status.
- [ ] Registry synchronization tests pass.
- [ ] Harness adapter tests pass.

## Implementation checklist for harness support

Please include these updates in the same PR:

- `dev_library_cli/cmd_doctor.py`: add diagnose, patch, and cleanup coverage for the harness
- `dev_library_cli/layer.py`: update `HARNESS_LAYER_CONFIGS` and managed-file attribution paths
- `README.md`: add the harness to the supported harness list
- `docs/adding-a-harness.md`: keep checklist requirements aligned when needed
